## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my bootcamp and personal learning journey:

### 🔸 se_project_library
This was my first web development project using only HTML and CSS. I created a simple library website and learned the basics of layout and styling. It was also my first time working with Flexbox, which helped me understand responsive design.

### 🔸 se_project_coffeeshop
For this project, I built a coffee shop website using only HTML and CSS. I learned how to create and style navigation links and deepened my understanding of the BEM naming convention for writing cleaner, more organized code.

### 🔸 se_project_spots
Spots was my first project using basic JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. I learned how to add simple interactivity and also began working with media queries to make the site responsive across different device sizes.

### 🔸 se_project_react | What to wear?
What to wear was a project that introduced react to my codebase and taught me how to use and implement API's to provide a backend that allows users to add clothing items to their own local machines. The goal of this project was to make a project that lets users know the weather in their current location and furthermore let them know what would be wise to wear given the weather and their clothing inputs.
