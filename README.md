## 📂 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my bootcamp and personal learning journey:

### 🔸 se_project_library
This was my first web development project using only HTML and CSS. I created a simple library website and learned the basics of layout and styling. It was also my first time working with Flexbox, which helped me understand responsive design.

### 🔸 se_project_coffeeshop
For this project, I built a coffee shop website using only HTML and CSS. I learned how to create and style navigation links and deepened my understanding of the BEM naming convention for writing cleaner, more organized code.

Spots was my first project using basic JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. I learned how to add simple interactivity and also began working with media queries to make the site responsive across different device sizes.
